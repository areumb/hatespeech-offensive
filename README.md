# HateCheck-XR
HateCheck (Rottger et al. 2021) and an existing extension (Khurana et al. 2025) of HateCheck were re-annotated into 3 classes (hateful, offensive, clean), fixing the latter's annotation errrors. 
Combined and re-annotated, they're called HateCheck-XR, and can be found in the dataset directory (rows unsorted at the moment).

There is a lot of part you should manually edit every time to train/evaluate on different types of classification systems, both in the .py files and config files.

HateCheck (Rottger et al. 2021) and an existing extension (Khurana et al. 2025) of HateCheck were re-annotated into 3 classes, fixing the latter's annotation errrors.
